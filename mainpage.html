            <h1>Hello you 2 years from now, this is a training page made by your own ass</h1>
            <p>I bet this will be a cheesy line, but I hope you got yourself a lot of knowledge in programming. I also hope that you will be successful in life, especially that 2 years from now. I also hope that you will say something like "Well, I am glad that I learned how to code. Now I mastered machine learning and AI."</p>
            <p>Good luck to you as always.</p>

            <h2>Center Command Example</h2>
            <div class="centerList">
                <p>Here, I will demonstrate the center alignment in css. It is another way to simulate the text alignment other than using the attribute "text-align" in html.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, for the image part, we have 2 options to make it centered:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using block display and auto margins for the left and right</li>
                    <li>Using figure tag and figcaption tag for the caption</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Note: The block display and auto margins can be used for almost every type of media. This includes pictures and videos.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <div class="terminator">
                <figure class="figureTerminator" role="group">

        <div><hr><h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
            <p>According to Google, hyperlink is a link from a hypertext file or document to another location or file. It is typically activate by clicking on a highlighted word or image on the screen.</p>
            <h3>Absolute References</h3>
            <p>Absolute reference is a type of link used in basicLinks.html. Absolute references always begin with the protocol name. An absolute reference is the complete address to a web page, just as you'd use in the browser's address bar. Absolute references are used to refer to a site somewhere else on the Internet.</p>
            <p>Even if your website moves (say, from your desktop machine to a web server somewhere on the internet), all the absolute references will work fine because they don't rely on the current page's position for any information.</p>
            <p>Example: <a href="https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/html5-and-css3/absolute-and-relative-references-for-html5-and-css3-programming/#:~:text=Absolute%20references,-The%20type%20of&text=html%20is%20an%20absolute%20reference,somewhere%20else%20on%20the%20Internet." aria-label="Absolute Reference" target="_blank">https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/html5-and-css3/absolute-and-relative-references-for-html5-and-css3-programming/</a></p>
            <div><h3>Relative References</h3>
                <p>Now, it's time for relative reference. Relative reference is a type of link mechanism for your website. For example, your website have several pages in them. You can link those pages so that the user can access it more easily using relative references.</p>
                <p>When you click one of the links, you go to a brand-new page. That brand-new page should also contain a link back to the initial page using relative reference. Most websites aren't single pages at all, but an interconnected web of pages. The relative reference is very useful when you have a set of pages with interlacing links.</p>
                <p>I will be using lists this example.</p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This link goes to <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Index</a></li>
                        <li>This one goes to <a href="Coba_cobi.html" target="_self">CatPhotoApp</a></li>
                        <li>etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div><hr><h2>HTML Multimedia</h2>
            <p>These multimedia elements include many things, such as images, video, and audio. We can implement these things inside our website using tags like &lt;video&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;, and &lt;img&gt;</p>
            <p>Here I will give you examples of each kind of multimedia.</p>
            <div><h3>Video</h3>
                <video src="Comp_1-1(1).m4v" class="yellowClaw" controls>Yellow Claw Newbie Music Video Project</video>
                <p>In here, I successfully implemented the video tag. As you can see, the video have control properties in it because we put an attribute called "controls" inside the video tag.</p>
                <p>There are other attributes that can be used inside a video tag. These are href, class, controls, loop, autoplay, etc.</p>
                <p>Please make sure that the video tag includes the control attribute to make the video more accessible and interactive to the user.</p></div>
            <div><h3>Audio</h3>
                <p>The next stop will be the audio tag. This tag, as the name implies, is used to display audio using html. The tag is simple, it is written like this &lt;audio&gt;.</p>
                <p>Like the video tag, the audio tag has several attributes that can be used inside it. Such as, href, class, controls, loop, autoplay, buffered, etc.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of the audio tag in use:</p>
                <audio src="Matthew_Piano.mp3" controls>Sampai Jadi Debu Piano Cover by Matthew Gabriel</audio>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Image</h3>
                <p>The image tag is a common media tag. I have used this tag previously to display the terminator image. The tag itself is simple like the other multimedia tags, &lt;img&gt;</p>
                <p>You will have to use the href attribute like the other multimedia tag to display the picture from the source. Don't forget to put it inside the same folder so that the link can display it easily if you are using a relative reference.</p>
                <p>WARNING: Image tag is a SELF-CLOSING TAG!</p>
                <p>This will be an example of the tag using a relative reference:</p>
                <img src="RDJ.jpg" class="imageRDJ" alt="Image Example">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div><hr>
            <h2>Tables</h2>
            <p>We should only use tables if we have some kind of data being displayed. Please note that sketching your table beforehand is much easier than correcting wrong tables.</p>
            <p>The tag that we use to make tables are simple. It consists of &lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;. Inside the table tag, we have another tag to represent the rows and column. It should look something like this</p>
            <p>&lt;table&gt;<br>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;One&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Two&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Three&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Four&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Five&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Six&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Seven&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Eight&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Nine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>&lt;/table&gt;</p>
            <table>
                <tr><td>One</td><td>Two</td><td>Three</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Four</td><td>Five</td><td>Six</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Seven</td><td>Eight</td><td>Nine</td></tr>
            </table>
            <div>
                <h3>Table Headings</h3>
                <p>There are also table headings. We can use a tag called th or table heading to represent the semantics of a table heading</p>
                <p>The example will be like this:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Date of Birth</th></tr>
                    <tr><td>Ricky</td><td>28 Jan 2002</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Catherine</td><td>12 Jul 2001</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Maggie</td><td>7 Aug 2003</td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Column Span and Row Span</h3>
                <p>We can use colspan and rowspan to merge columns or rows into one. For example:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>Artist Name</th><th>Song Title</th></tr>
                    <tr><td rowspan="3">Yellow Claw</td><td>Bass God</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Amsterdamned</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Fot the thrill</td></tr>
                    <tr><td rowspan="2">K/DA</td><td>MORE</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>THE BADDEST</td></tr>
                </table>
            </div>
        </div>
    </body>
